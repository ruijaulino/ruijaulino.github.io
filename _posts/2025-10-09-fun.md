# Funny shapes

By design some strategies have asymmetric payoffs; for example, it is known that trading with a moving average produces a skewed distribution in trade returns. Can we make money on this shape alone? Can the asymmetry induce growth? 

$G = \mathbb{E}\left\[ \log(1+wx) \right\] < \log \left( \mathbb{E}\left\[ 1+wx \right\] \right) = \log \left(1+w\mu \right)$

if $\mu$ is zero then $G < 0$.

This rules out the possbility to make money with repeated bets on some _funny_ shape (make a lot a few times and losing a bit many times) without any edge.


#### General case

The full case is when we have some vector features $z$ to predict a vector of returns $x$. The same conclusion holds as we can write

$G = \mathbb{E}\left\[ \log(1+w(z)^T x) \right\] < \log \left( \mathbb{E}\left\[ 1+w(z)^Tx \right] \right) =  \log \left( 1+ \mathbb{E}\left\[w(z)^Tx \right] \right) $ 

then we can notice:

$\mathbb{E}\left\[w(z)^Tx \right] = \text{tr}\left( \text{cov}\left(w(z), x\right) \right) + \mathbb{E}\left\[w(z)\right]^T\mathbb{E}\left\[x\right]$

from where we can see we have two contributions: one from how the weights are correlated with the targets (note that weights must have positive correlation with targets otherwise it does not make sense to use them) and another from the expected values. The analogue to the no edge case is $\mathbb{E}\left\[x\right] = 0$ and $\text{cov}\left(w(z), x\right) = 0$ for any $x$.

Again, if there is no edge, $G<0$, establishing that we cannot make money out of the shape of the distribution only.
