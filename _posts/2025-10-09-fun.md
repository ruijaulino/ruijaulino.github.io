# Funny shapes

By design some strategies have asymmetric payoffs; for example, it is known that trading with a moving average produces a skewed distribution in trade returns. Can we make money on this shape alone? Can the asymmetry induce growth? 

$G = \mathbb{E}\left\[ \log(1+wx) \right\] < \log \left( \mathbb{E}\left\[ 1+wx \right\] \right) = \log \left(1+w\mu \right)$

if $\mu$ is zero then $G < 0$.

This rules out the possbility to make money with repeated bets on some _funny_ shape (make a lot a few times and losing a bit many times) without any edge.


##### General case

The full case is when we have some vector features $z$ to predict a vector of returns $x$. The same conclusion holds as

$G = \mathbb{E}\left\[ \log(1+w(z)^T x) \right\] = \mathbb{E}_z \left\[ \mathbb{E}\_{x|z} \left\[ \log(1+w(z)^T x) \right\] \right\] < \mathbb{E}_z \left\[ \log \left(  \mathbb{E}\_{x|z} \left\[ 1+w(z)^T x \right\]  \right) \right\] = \mathbb{E}_z \left\[ \log \left( 1+w(z)^T \mu\_{x\|z}\right) \right\] $ 

again, if there is no edge, $\mu_{x\|z} = 0$; then $G<0$.
