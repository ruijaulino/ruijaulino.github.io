# Funny shapes

By design some strategies have asymmetric payoffs; for example, it is known that trading with a moving average produces a skewed distribution in trade returns. Can we make money on this shape alone? Can the asymmetry induce growth? 

$G = \mathbb{E}\left\[ \log(1+wx) \right\] < \log \left( \mathbb{E}\left\[ 1+wx \right\] \right) = \log \left(1+w\mu \right)$

if $\mu$ is zero then $G < 0$.

This rules out the possbility to make money with repeated bets on some _funny_ shape (make a lot a few times and losing a bit many times) without any edge.
