### Description

Aerospace Engineer by formation that went from fluid turbulence to financial markets!

Currently I am a quantitative trader in a hedge fund where I develop and manage quantitative strategies for futures and cash equities.

Having worked mostly in small companies I have always been involved in many steps of the process: from architeture and building of trading infrastructure, to database management and, of course, research and development of trading models.  

Below there is a link to my full CV.
